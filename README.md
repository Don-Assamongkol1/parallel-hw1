# parallel-hw1
Code is in /src and /tests directory

Inside the main parallel-hw1 repo we have the writeup (dassamongkol_hw1_writeup.pdf), 
code I used to generate the graphs (graphing.ipynb), and files associated with testing 
(sanity_check.py and test_module.py). All other files are part of the test set up; you 
can read test_module.py for more info.
